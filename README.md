#  Evento — Cloud-Native Event Management Platform

Evento is a **cloud-native, centralized event management platform** designed to handle the complete lifecycle of events — from creation and discovery to registration and real-time interaction — across multiple domains.

The platform supports **all types of events**, including entertainment, educational, political, organizational, and city-wide events, through a single, unified system.

---

##  Problem Statement

Event management today is often fragmented across messaging apps, spreadsheets, and static websites. These approaches lack scalability, real-time updates, centralized control, and proper access management.

Evento addresses this problem by providing a **single cloud-based platform** that enables efficient event organization, discovery, and participation with scalability and security built in.

##  Objectives

- Centralize management of all event types in one platform
- Enable easy event creation, publishing, and registration
- Support role-based access for different user types
- Ensure scalability and reliability using cloud-native principles
- Provide a smooth, modern, and interactive user experience
- Design the system for future extensibility and real-world usage

---

##  Domain Overview

**Domain:** Cloud Computing & Web Applications

Evento is built using **cloud-native architecture principles**, focusing on:
- Stateless backend services
- Event-driven workflows
- Scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure
- Secure access control and monitoring

---

##  User Roles

- **Admin** – Manages platform-level configurations and monitoring
- **Organizer** – Creates, publishes, and manages events

##  How Evento Works

1. **Create Events**  
   Organizers create events with essential details such as category, date, location, and description.

2. **Publish & Manage**  
   Events are published to the platform and managed from a centralized dashboard.

3. **Discover & Register**  
   Users explore events by category and register seamlessly.

4. **Live Updates & Insights**  
   The platform delivers real-time updates and participation insights for better coordination.
